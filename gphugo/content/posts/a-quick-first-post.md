This is just quick first test post to make sure the blog is functioning. Once I verify functionality and do a quick check for glossiness, I'll be adding in the actual store page and then we're live. I'll do a new post when we get there to tell you more about it, but it's basically a quick way for people to start developing their own square storefront with very little setup required on their end. It requires a lot of intervention to get set up right now, but resolving that is definitely in the future.
